# End-to-End Generative AI

This repository documents my personal research, system-level understanding, and hands-on experimentation with **end-to-end Generative AI systems**.

This is not a collection of definitions or tutorials.  
It is a record of how I understand Generative AI by building, breaking, and designing real systems.
