# End-to-End Generative AI

This repository documents my personal research, system-level understanding, and hands-on experimentation with **end-to-end Generative AI systems**.

This is not a collection of definitions or tutorials.  
It is a record of how I understand Generative AI by building, breaking, and designing real systems.

## What This Repo Focuses On
- Foundation models (LLMs & SLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompting as probability control
- Agentic systems and tool use
- Failure modes, evaluation, and guardrails
- Deployment-oriented system design
